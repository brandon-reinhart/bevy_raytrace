# bevy_raytrace

A toy wavefront ray tracer using Bevy. Just for learning.

Tasks:
- [x] wavefront (generate -> intersect -> shade)
- [ ] stochastic primary rays
- [ ] material response
- [ ] extension rays
- [ ] shadow rays
- [ ] depth of field
- [ ] wavefront loop
- [ ] add surface primitive
- [ ] rapier on objects so they can roll around
